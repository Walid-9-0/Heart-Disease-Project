Heart Disease Prediction Project
This project focuses on predicting heart disease using a dataset and various machine-learning models. The notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation steps.

Key Steps:
Data Loading and Exploration: Understand the dataset structure and perform initial data analysis.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, normalize data, and encode categorical variables.
Modeling: Implement various models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and more.
Evaluation: Compare models using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.


Tools and Libraries:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
